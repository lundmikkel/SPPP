Exercise 9.1
============

Question 1
----------
The <code>forEach</code> and <code>reallocate</code> methods are not covered by
the tests in the <code>testMap</code> method. 

To cover the <code>forEach</code> method we made a test ensuring that the sum of
iterations is equal to the amount of buckets. Also, we tested if the inserted
ItemNodes are outputtet by the method

To cover the <code>reallocate</code> method we made a test ensuring that the 
content is the same after execution. Unfortunately. it is not possible to test 
that the size of the buckets array has increased or if the ItemNodes is still
in the same stripe after reallocation.

After running the tests, the implementation seems to be correct.
