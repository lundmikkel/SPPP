Exercise 4.1
============

Question 1
----------
The results of the measurements of the mark* methods are placed in the
'benchmarks' folder together with the system info.

Our benchmarks are almost identical to the ones made by Peter, so we conclude
that they are very plausible.

In the Ex4_1_6 benchmarks we experienced a large deviation which might be
because of concurrent programs running on the computer and maybe because of
the garbage collector as it is similar to Peter's results where it does the
same.

Question 2
----------
Our results are stored in the benchmarks folder. Our benchmarks of mark7 shows
that the stronger computer (Ex4_2_1) is faster than (Ex4_2_2) as expected. It is
a little strange that the deviation of Ex4_2_2 is consistently larger than the
other. This could be because the computer running Ex4_2_2 having more programs
running and thus each of the benchmark runs doesn't have the same basis.
